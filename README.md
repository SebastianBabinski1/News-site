# News-site

## Hello!

I'm Sebastian and it's my simple project aimed at improving my skills in javascript, typescript and modules scss. 
Project presents site, which renderes news from API:

https://www.spaceflightnewsapi.net/

- On the website applied the "infinite scroll", which renders next X articles.
At the beginning number of fetching articles is equal 15.
User can change it by predefined buttons or by typing his own number.

- If article is interesting, you can save it (or, if you no longer need article in library, remove it).
We can check our saved articles in library, which is separate site.

- You have possibility to sort articles in library by date of publication or by title.

- To challenge myself I desided now to use React or other libraries. 
Many things could be simplified with React, but it's not the purpose of the project.

To run site use command 
```webpack serve```
